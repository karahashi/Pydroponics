To begin with, I tested the PH level of our tap water and found it too alkaline. So small amount of fresh lemon juice was added to bring the PH more in line with what was needed. Sadly at this current time there is no real way for me to make an accurate test until I can acquire a PH meter.

Rather then selecting microgreens or lettuce, things that are more beginner friendly. I decided to chose vegetables that I would really enjoy myself. 

-Tomatoes
-Peppers
-Green Beans

I planted the seeds in to rockwool cubes that have been soaked in water with lemon for 30mins and then placed on a propagator tray with a lid then placed an a shelving unit under a grow light connected to a timer. The light is set to come on at 7am till 11pm.
