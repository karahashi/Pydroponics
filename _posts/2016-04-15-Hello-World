-Hello World, I'm Frazer Grunshaw a mid 20's tech enthusiast from Lancashire, England.
 I recently started a small indoor hydroponics project(with no prior growing experience), with a view to incorporate some way of recording information and data. With the resent release of the Raspberry Pi 3, I thought it would be a great addition and tool for this task.

-So here we are, This is Pydroponics. A platform for me to keep a record of the project.
