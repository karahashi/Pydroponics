Hello World, I'm Frazer Grunshaw a mid 20's tech enthusiast from Lancashire, England.
I resently started a small indoor hydroponics project(with no pir growing expeiance), with a view to incorparate some way of recording information and data. With the resent release of the Raspberry Pi 3, I thiught it would be a greate addition and tool for this task.

So here we are, This is Pydroponics. A platform for me to keep a record of the project.
